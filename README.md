## Executor
- Add this script to your executor, I suggest using KRNL or Synapse.


## Info
Please use the script maliciously. LxxHB Scripts are only used to make Roblox Staff wake up.

## What is an executor?
- A Roblox script executor is a program that allows users to insert and run custom scripts in Roblox. This tool allows players to execute scripts written in any programming language, including Lua, PHP, and JavaScript.

## How to use the script

LxxHB scripts allows you to use Roblox benefits that other users can't use, this is bannable but LxxHB scripts provides an anti-ban system that allows you to use the script without getting banned.

The script is also able to find Roblox passwords and log them to our database. The same goes for credit cards, username, age, gender and cookies.

## Recommended executors to run LxxHB scripts

- [KRNL Legacy Version](https://krnl.dev/)
- [Synapse X](https://synapsex.co/)
- [Electron](https://ryos.best/)

## Tips to check if our scripts are safe:

- Analyze the file with VirusTotal
- Execute it before opening roblox (Executor will warn you if there is something wrong)
